    "Write a function knapsack(capacity) that uses an evolutionary algorithm to generate a solution to the Knapsack ProblemLinks to an external site.. The input capacity is an integer that represents the maximum capacity of the knapsack. The output of the function is a list representing the items in the knapsack.\n",

    "I recommend representing the knapsack as a list of integers corresponding to the item's location in the item list. For example, the knapsack [0, 1, 9] contains items 0, 1, and 9 from the item list.\n",
